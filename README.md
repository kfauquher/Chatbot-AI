# Chatbot-AI
A chatbot AI that provides information for a business using neural networks.

I added more notes then normal to help with my learning process.

JSON file comments-
//This is how our chatbot is going to figure out what the user is trying to say. For example if a user says 'Hello how are you today?" the bot will respond with a greeting response. The user does not need to say exactly what the pattern is, just a few key words so the bot can get the gist of it.
